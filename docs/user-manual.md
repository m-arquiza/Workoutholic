<!-- A high-level description. What does the system do and why would a user want to use it. -->
# Description
Workoutholic is a dynamic fitness app that goes beyond conventional workout tracking by incorporating an entertaining mini-game experience. Our primary focus is to assist users in achieving their workout goals while ensuring they stay engaged and motivated throughout their fitness journey. For the workout portion of the app, we offer a workout logger that has selection from hundreds of workouts from our database for the user to track their workout. We also offer a workout statistic interface that shows graphical analysis of a userâ€™s workout progress. For the gaming portion of the app, the user is able to use the currency that they have accumulated from working out in our dog mini-game. In the game, the user will take care of a dog named Shiba, who has hunger, thirst, and happiness status bars. The user is able to exchange the currency for food and water for Shiba, as well as additional items found in the store interface. Through our research, we found that the user retention rate for fitness apps are very high. We feel that with the combination of fitness and gaming, through our engaging mini game, it will help retain the user to continue using the app and better themselves physically and mentally.

<!-- How to report a bug. This should include not just the mechanics (a pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed. You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an example for bug reporting guidelines.
When the user has encountered a bug, they are encourage to contact any if not all of the contributors to our project, in which our contact information can be found on the github repository page. We are all available as soon as possible to help the user to resolve the bugs. -->
## Submitting a bug report
To submit a bug report, the user should follow the below guideline:
1. Steps to reproduce the bug: If the user can provide the steps to reproduce the bug, this can help the programmers trace back to the beginning and effectively walk through the steps to find the location of the bug.
2. Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior: Writing down the expected with actual behavior report can help the programmer understand the intended functionality, and compare it with the actual behavior.
3. Specific type of bugs: Whether the program crashed, is slow or non-responsive, knowing the specific type of bugs can direct the programmers to the actual problem quicker. 
4. Any additional information.
