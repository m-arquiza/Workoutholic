## Description
Workoutholic is a dynamic fitness app that goes beyond conventional workout tracking by incorporating an entertaining mini-game experience. Our primary focus is to assist users in achieving their workout goals while ensuring they stay engaged and motivated throughout their fitness journey. For the workout portion of the app, we offer a workout logger with hundreds of workout options to track your progress. Additionally, we provide a workout statistics interface that offers graphical analysis of your workout progress. The app also features a gaming component, where users can use in-app currency to take care of a virtual dog named Shiba. Through this engaging mini-game, users can exchange currency for food, water, and other items to keep Shiba happy and healthy.
