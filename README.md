# Workoutholic
Workoutholic is a Java based app/game that would be ran on the Android mobile platform. This app would help log exercises and create workout plans where the user is able to input exercises, weights, repetitions, sets, and length/time. The app would keep track of the users workouts to show to the user's progress via things such as charts or graphs. What's different about this app compared to other fitness trackers because we incorporated a game into. 70% of users stop using their fitness tracker after 3 months. With our game, we hope to lower that percentage. Everytime a user logs a workout or exercise, they are rewarded with points/currency. They can use that currency in our game, which would be focused on a pet dog. The user would be able to spend these points for the dog such as clothes/ accessories. Everytime the user works out, they take care of the dog. Creating a fun interactive game that keeps you wanting to go to the gym.
