### Last Week's Goals:
- Finish my portion before Alpha Release
- Connect database to app - make sure correct information is displayed
- Finish working on shop data storage/retrieval
- Finish working on inventory data storage/retrieval
- Figure out backend automated testing
- Figure out how to control vitals

### Progress Report:
- Possibly changed database method to SQLite

- Figure out how to database to app - make sure correct information is displayed
- Write more backend tests
- Figure out backend automated testing
- Figure out how to control vitals
- Figure out how to control toy buying/storing in inventory

## Kenny
### Last Week's Goals:
Finishing basic implementation on Android Studio.

### Progress Report:
* What I did: I finished the basic implementation for the workout side. 
* What worked: I was able to have basic functionality for a user logging a workout.
* What I had trouble: Making the workout logger, it had a lot of components like muscle group, workouts, etc. that were hard to connect to each other.
* Where I am stuck: Currently I want to make more methods so the user can track more workouts and exercises.

## Next Week's Goals:
Finish my portion of the beta release.
